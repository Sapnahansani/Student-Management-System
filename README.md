Developed a menu-driven student management application in Java. Implemented core functionalities including:

Checking available seats
Registering and deleting students (with ID)
Searching student records
Storing and loading details from a file
Viewing students sorted by name
Entering module marks and generating reports

The system was designed with arrays, file I/O, and object-oriented principles, providing a simple CLI interface for efficient record management.
